  Something is wrong about buggle 'ant':
    Its position is (7,33); expected: (48,57).
    The color of its brush is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=0]; expected: java.awt.Color[r=255,g=255,b=255].

  Something is wrong about buggle 'ant':
    Its position is (37,33); expected: (45,60).
    The color of its brush is java.awt.Color[r=255,g=255,b=255]; expected: java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=0].
